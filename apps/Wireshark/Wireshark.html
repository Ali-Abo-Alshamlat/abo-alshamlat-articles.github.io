                Task 1: Introduction
            </h1>

            Which file is used to simulate the screenshots?

            <h3>
                Ans: http1.pcapng
            </h3>

            Which file is used to answer the questions

            <h3>
                Ans: Exercise.pcapng
            </h3>

            <h1>
                Task 2: Tool Overview
            </h1>

            Use the “Exercise.pcapng” file to answer the questions.

            Read the “capture file comments”.

            What is the flag?

            <h3>
                Ans: TryHackMe_Wireshark_Demo
            </h3>

            Open the pcap file and open the capture file properties dialog 
            on the bottom left-side of the status bar.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-2.png"/>

            What is the total number of packets?

            <h3>
                Ans: 58620
            </h3>

            What is the SHA256 hash value of the capture file?

            <h3>
                Ans: f446de335565fb0b0ee5e5a3266703c778b2f3dfad7efeaeccb2da5641a6d6eb

            <h1>
                Task 3: Packet Dissection
            </h1>

            Use the “Exercise.pcapng” file to answer the questions.

            View packet number 38. Which markup language is used under the HTTP protocol?

            <h3>
                Ans: eXtensible Markup Language
            </h3>

            Press ctrl+g. That will open a dialog box to find specific packets, then ente
            38 and click the button. We should be directed to packet 38.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-4.png"/>

            Within the packet details pane, under the HTTP protocol is the Markup Language used.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-5.png"/>

            What is the arrival date of the packet? (Answer format: Month/Day/Year)

            <h3>
                Ans: 05/13/2004
            </h3>

            Still on packet 38, expand the Frame and it will show the details specific to
            the Physical layer of the OSI model.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-6.png"/>

            What is the TTL value?

            <h3>
                Ans: 47
            </h3>

            The TTL value is found in Layer 3 of the OSI model, which is the Network
            Layer. Expand the Internet Protocol within the packet details pane.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-7.png"/>

            What is the TCP payload size?

            <h3>
                Ans: 424
            </h3>

            TCP details are found within the Transmission Control Protocol pane, which
            is the 4th layer of the OSI model.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-8.png"/>

            What is the e-tag value?

            <h3>
                Ans: 9a01a-4696–7e354b00
            </h3>

            This particular value is found in Hypertext Transfer Protocol pane, from the
            Application protocol layer of the OSI model.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-9.png"/>

            <h3>
                Task 4: Packet Navigation
            </h3>

            Use the “Exercise.pcapng” file to answer the questions.

            Search the “r4w” string in packet details. What is the name of artist 1?

            <h3>
                Ans: r4w8173
            </h3>

            Press ctrl+f to search for the string inside the packets.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-10.png"/>

            Within the details pane is the name of artist 1.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-11.png"/>

            Go to packet 12 and read the comments. What is the answer?

            <h3>
                Ans: 911cd574a42865a956ccde2d04495ebf
            </h3>

            Press ctrl+g and enter the packet number and we will be directed to that packet.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-12.png"/>

            We see that there is a comment in the details pane but it is incomplete. To
            read the full comment, we will go to Edit menu then select Packet Comment.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-13.png"/>

            Upon reading the comment, we will go to packet 39765, look at the packet
            details pane and export the packet bytes by right-clicking on the JPEG
            section. As stated, this is another way of extracting data or objects from a
            pcap file. I saved the JPEG file as “jpeg” in the Desktop directory.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-14.png"/>

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-15.png"/>

            Open a terminal and we will extract the MD5 hash value of the image.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-16.png"/>

            There is a “.txt” file inside the capture file. Find the file and read it; 
            what is the alien’s name?

            <h3>
                Ans: PACKETMASTER
            </h3>

            This is another method of exporting objects from a pcap file. Go to File
            menu then select Export Objects and then HTTP (or whatever protocol that
            may have been used to transfer objects). Save the “note.txt” file.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-17.png"/>

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-18.png"/>

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-19.png"/>

            We can actually read the contents of the text file on the details pane but the
            objective of this task is for us to learn how to export objects.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-20.png"/>

            Open and read the contents of the file. We can use a text editor or terminal
            to read the contents.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-21.png"/>

            Look at the expert info section. What is the number of warnings?

            <h3>
                Ans: 1636
            </h3>

            We can either go to Analyze Menu then select Expert Information or at the
            bottom left part of the status bar and click on the first image.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-22.png"/>

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-23.png"/>

            <h1>
                Task 5: Packet Filtering
            </h1>

            Go to packet number 4. Right-click on the “Hypertext Transfer Protocol” and
            apply it as a filter. Now, look at the filter pane. What is the filter query?

            <h3>
                Ans: http
            </h3>

            Press ctrl+g and enter packet number 4. Follow the instructions provided
            then look at the Display filter of what filter has been applied.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-24.png"/>

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-25.png"/>

            What is the number of displayed packets?

            <h3>
                Ans: 1089
            </h3>

            It is displayed at the bottom right-side of the status bar.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-26.png"/>

            Go to packet number 33790 and follow the stream. What is the total number of artists?

            <h3>
                Ans: 3
            </h3>

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-27.png"/>

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-28.png"/>

            From the HTTP Stream we can search for the string “artist”.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-29.png"/>

            What is the name of the second artist?

            <h3>
                Ans: Blad3
            </h3>

            Modify the string to artist=2.

            <img src="../../public/images/Wireshark/Wireshark-30.png"/>
