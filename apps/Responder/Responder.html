            TASK 1 — When visiting the web service using the IP address, what is the
            domain that we are being redirected to?

            When attempting to access the IP address through a web browser, it will
            redirect to unika.htb, but the connection will not succeed.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-2.png"/>

            In order to view the webpage, you will need to add the target IP to the
            /etc/hosts file. Then, open a text file editor in the terminal and enter the
            hostname and IP address of the page.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-3.png"/>

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-4.png"/>

            The page will now load in the web browser.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-5.png"/>

            TASK 2 — Which scripting language is being used on the server to generate webpages?

            Running Nmap scan to generate a list of available ports. The results showed
            that port 80 for web service is active and provided details about the service.
            In addition, itindicated that Apache is using PHP to generate the webpage.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-6.png"/>

            TASK 3 — What is the name of the URL parameter which is used to load
            different language versions of the webpage?

            To switch between other languages, the page parameter is utilized. Once the
            language is changed, the URL in the address bar reflects this change, as
            illustrated in the example below.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-7.png"/>

            TASK 4 — Which of the following values for the `page` parameter would be
            an example of exploiting a Local File Include (LFI) vulnerability:
            “french.html,” “//10.10.14.6/somefile”,
            “../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts”, “minikatz.exe”

            To exploit a Local File Include vulnerability, the parameter used is
            ../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts. Using “../” enables access to
            the “etc/hosts.”

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-8.png"/>

            TASK 5 — Which of the following values for the `page` parameter would be
            an example of exploiting a Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerability:
            “french.html,” “//10.10.14.6/somefile”,
            “../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts”, “minikatz.exe”

            To exploit the Remote File Include, it needs to have an IP address of the
            target machine, in this case,//10.10.14.6/somefile.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-9.png"/>

            TASK 6 — What does NTLM stand for?

            NTLM stands for New Technology LAN Manager, which comprises a group of
            security protocols designed for Microsoft Windows. It employs a challenge-
            response mechanism to authenticate clients and servers. However, Microsoft
            advises against using NTLM for contemporary applications because of its
            insufficient encryption.

            TASK 7 — Which flag do we use in the Responder utility to specify the
            network interface?

            Responder uses a flag denoted by -I followed by the interface name to
            specify the networking interface.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-10.png"/>

            First, identify the IP using the command “ip a |grep + network interface.”

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-11.png"/>

            We can check if Responder captures an event to see if Responder is working
            correctly. To do this, attempt to open a shared file using the IP and a shared
            folder name on your web browser. However, this action will likely be denied
            due to the folder needing to be available and needing permission.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-12.png"/>

            In the terminal where Responder was operating, NTLM information
            includes the client's IP, username, and password hash.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-13.png"/>

            TASK 8 — There are several tools that take a NetNTLMv2
            challenge/response and try millions of passwords to see if any of them
            generate the same response. One such tool is often referred to as `john`,
            but the full name is what?.

            Once you have copied the hash, use the command "echo" to transfer it into a
            file. Afterward, verify that the file has been saved by checking the directory
            using the "ls" command.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-14.png"/>

            Next, follow these steps to unzip the “RockYou” wordlist file.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-15.png"/>

            I used the command “john” to execute the wordlist and match it with the
            password hash file.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-16.png"/>

            TASK 9 — What is the password for the administrator user?

            The administrator user’s password is “badminton,” which was determined
            from the step-by-step instructions in the previous task.


            TASK 10 — We’ll use a Windows service (i.e. running on the box) to remotely
            access the Responder machine using the password we recovered. What port
            TCP does it listen on?

            The TCP port it listens on is 5985; its information can be easily found by
            scanning with Nmap.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-17.png"/>

            SUBMIT FLAG

            Let’s proceed with the flag hunt by utilizing evil-winrm, a package that
            includes Windows Remote Management for accessing the target computer.
            Finally, we have all the necessary information, including the IP address,
            username, and password.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-18.png"/>

            To move between directories and folders, the command “cd” can be used,
            while the contents of a folder can be listed using “dir.” The flag was hidden on the user Mike.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-19.png"/>

            To reveal the flag, use the “type” command.

            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-20.png"/>


            <img src="../../public/images/Responder/Responder-21.png"/>

            I have all the answers to the tasks in the images provided. Pweding
            Responder machine was such a fun experience!
