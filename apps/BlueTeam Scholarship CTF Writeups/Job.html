            In this one, we got an .eml file, which is an extension of an email file.
            Checking it with any mail software or text editor, you can notice that there is
            an attachment that was sent with the email.

            So, downloading the docx file and checking if there is any macors inside it
            with oletools. <h3>olevba -c document.docx</h3>

            We are going to notice there is VBA Macro inside the document, but it is
            base64 encoded. Decode it.
