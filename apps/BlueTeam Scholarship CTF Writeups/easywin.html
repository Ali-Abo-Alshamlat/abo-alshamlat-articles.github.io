            After opening the link, we got this site that says you don’t need an account.

            <img src="../../public/images/BlueTeam Scholarship CTF Writeups/easywin/easywin-1.png"/>

            Looking at the source code, we see this JS code that is obfuscated.

            <img src="../../public/images/BlueTeam Scholarship CTF Writeups/easywin/easywin-2.png"/>

            Looking closely at that code

            <img src="../../public/images/BlueTeam Scholarship CTF Writeups/easywin/easywin-3.png"/>

            We have something called  <h3>5up3res3cre3t.html</h3>, accessing this endpoint will

            NOW, I have included everything except two challenges, Serv3r, Admin and
            that’s because they are actually taken from Boss of the SOC v1 famous CTF,
            so you can just check any writeup for it, as it even contains more juicy
            information.
