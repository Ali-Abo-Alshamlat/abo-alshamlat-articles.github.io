            This is a writeup and first-time walkthrough of the 
            <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/burpsuitebasics">Burp Suite: The Basics room</a>

            Introduction : Task 1
            Getting Started: Tasks 2–7
            Proxy: Tasks 8–13
            Practical : Task 14
            Conclusion: Task 15
