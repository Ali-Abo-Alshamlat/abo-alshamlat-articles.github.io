                Task 14: Practical — Example Attack
            </h1>    

        This next task takes a look at a real world example of how we test user input 
        as part of a real-world web app pentest. The focus of this task will be to test 
        for Cross-Site Scripting or XSS (sending client side code such as JavaScript in a way that it executes) 
        and the type of XSS will be referred to as Reflected which means it only affects the person making the web request.

        I observed that there is a client-side filter in place of the “Contact Email” 
        field that prevented me from adding any special non-alphanumeric characters that are not allowed 
        in email addresses that can be found in script code. I will attempt to bypass the client-side filter with Burp Proxy.

        After making sure my Burp Proxy is active and the intercept option is on, 
        I proceeded to enter some legitimate input data such as “pentester@example.thm” for the email 
        and “Enjoy the payload” for the query text field. Next we submit the form, the request show be intercepted by the proxy.

        Once the request is grabbed by the proxy we can now change the email to be a client-side script such as the one below,

        <code>
             script> alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</ script >
        </code>

        after I pasted the payload, I selected it and used Ctrl + U to URL encode it
        before sending. after making sure the value in email is properly encoded, I
        then clicked the forward button on the Intercept page of Burp Proxy to send
        the modified request.

        Afterwards, we should get an alert box from the site that tells us the XSS
        attack was successful.

            There are no answers needed to submit, it involved going through and initiating
            the steps for an example XSS attack and we just need click the buttons to confirm
            we did each step
