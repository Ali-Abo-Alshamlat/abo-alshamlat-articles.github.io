            To switch Burp Suite to dark mode, I went into the settings tab.

            <img src="../../public/images/Burp Suite/task-7-1"/>

            Then under either the User or All tabs, I selected the User Interface
            dropdown option and went to Display sub-tab and under the Appearance
            menu, I selected the Dark radio button option.

            After reading each of the possible options under the Project settings. I was
            able to figure out the answer to the second question.

            One important note was I having an issue initially with finding the user
            options and project options when I was using a more recently updated
            version of Burp Suite. I found that the individual tabs for User options and
            Project options were all moved into a single Settings tab in a more recent of
            version of the Burp Suite greater version than v2022.9.5, which is what the
            TryHackMe attackbox VM uses at the time of this walkthrough.

        In which User options sub-tab can you change the Burp Suite update
        behaviour?

        What is the name of the section within the User options “Misc” sub-tab which
        allows you to change the Burp Suite keybindings?

        If we have uploaded Client-Side TLS certificates in the User options tab, can
        we override these on a per-project basis (Aye/Nay)?

        <blockquote>
            Aye
        </blockquote>

        There is a note that the Client TLS Certificates can be overridden for
        individual projects within the project options tab.

        There are many more configuration options available. Take the time to read
        through them.

        In the next section, we will cover the Burp Proxy — a much more hands-on
        aspect of the room.
