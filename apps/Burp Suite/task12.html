                Task 12 : Scoping and Targeting
            </h1>
            Notes

            I began to go to the Target tab and navigated to the Scope sub tab to add my
            machine’s IP address to specify what to target. I got a window prompt
            message from Burp Suite asking if we wanted to stop logging anything which
            isn't in the scope. I choose Yes in this case to disable logging for out of scope
            traffic.

            I found that the proxy will still be intercepting everything (e.g. get request to
            access google.com on my browser) and would need to turn this off. I
            proceeded to go into the Proxy Options sub-tab and check in “And URL Is in
            target scope” form the Intercept Client Requests section,

            Once I enabled that option, I attempted to go to google.com to test no
            requests are intercepted from it and as expected, requests were not being
            captured or logged by Burp Suite.

            I proceeded to test accessing the HTTP of the Bastion hosting IP address and
            was able to capture just that request and log it as well. The difference from
            when no scope was set was staggering as the number of times our web
            browser requests decreased and limited itself to what we set rather than
            having no scope and sending all incoming and outbound traffic to the Burp
            Proxy.
