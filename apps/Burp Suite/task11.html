            When trying to open the browser on Burp Suite on my TryHackMe AttackBox
            Virtual Machine, I was getting this error message as expected below trying to
            open the pre-configured browser, This is because of the current
            configuration options on our Burp Suite causing an error to be thrown.

            You will need to navigate through Project options tab → the Misc sub-tab

            I looked for the Burp’s Project options tab under the Misc sub tab and
            checked the checkbox designated Allow Burp’s browser to run without a
            sandbox. This allowed me to open the browser and test the proxy by sending
            requests to access sites on the Burp Suite tool preconfigured Chromium
            browser.

            I went back to the Proxy main tab under the Intercept option and tried to
            open the browser through the click Open Browser button and a Chromium
            browser opened up.

            I then entered my Linux VM’s IP address in the search bar http://10.10.54.47/

            Once I hit enter on the search tab to retrieve the request. I was able to
            intercept the request on my Burp Suite in my screenshot of my Burp Suite.
