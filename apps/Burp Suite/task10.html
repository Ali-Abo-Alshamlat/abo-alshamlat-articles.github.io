            I proceeded to follow along with the lab and learn how CAs work in the
            AttackBox VM, I found that there is a CA certificate already assigned to the
            PortSwigger company called PortSwigger CA. I proceeded to delete or
            distrust the certificate for the sake of recreating the issue of the missing CA
            certificate and following along with this lab by trying to access a example
            HTTPS URL address and adding the cert again.

            I attempted go to the https://google.com on Firefox with intercepting HTTPS
            request to access the website with the Burp proxy enabled and got the
            following a error telling us that the software Burp Proxy isnâ€™t authorized to
            secure the incoming HTTPS request.

            I went to http://burp/cert which downloaded a file called cacert.der as shown
            in the screenshot below. I saved it to my root folder so it can be added to the
            existing certificates

            I went into the settings options of the Firefox Browser by clicking on the
            hamburger button (button icon that is three straight lines) and clicked on
            Settings. Once in the settings menu, I used the search bar to find where the
            options related to certificates and clicked on the View Certificates option.

            When we click View Certificates we see all the trusted CA certificates on our
            browser. I clicked on the Import button as screenshotted below to add the
            cacert.der file that was downloaded

            I navigated to where the file was downloaded and checkmarked the Trust this
            CA to identify websites option and clicked the OK button to confirm that we
            trust this new Certificate Authority.

            After we clicked OK, I attempted to try to intercept the HTTPS request with
            Burp proxy to access the TLS enabled google.com and I was now able to
            access google.com without any error.
