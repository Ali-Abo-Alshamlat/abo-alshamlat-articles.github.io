            Notes

            For configuring our web browser to redirect traffic on it to our proxy, I first
            launched the Burp Proxy application on my VM to ensure the proxy service
            is reachable. In my case, my Burp Suite Event log shows the IP Address and
            port of my service.

            Next, I opened the Firefox browser and looked for a button at the top right-
            hand corner of my browser window,

            I found an existing proxy profile already on my VM and clicked on the
            options button to check what the existing proxy in FoxyProxy tool is
            configured to.

            I clicked with the following options clicked on the edit button or add button
            icon if we don’t have a proxy connection profile listed.

            I made sure the following settings were set up pointed at the proxy IP and
            the port of my proxy service (in this case is the default value of
            127.0.0.1:8080)

            Title: can be whatever we want it to be, e.g. Burp
            IP Address: 127.0.0.1
            Port: 8080

            Next, I selected the proxy titled Burp and the green check mark appeared
            next to the name of the proxy connection and as well as the name of the
            proxy appeared over the extension icon as seen below to indicate we a have a
            proxy running,

            <img src="/public/images/Burp Suite/task9-5.png"/>

            I switched back to my open instance of Burp Suite and navigated to Proxy >
            Intercept sub tab screen to make sure the message interception is on before
            testing the proxy for catching requests. This is done by clicking the button
            starting with Intercept and followed by “is off” or “is on” depending on if
            intercept is turned off or on as per the screenshot below,

            <img src="/public/images/Burp Suite/task9-7.png"/>

            Once intercept is turned on, I attempted to access the homepage of the
            machine we which in my case was http://10.10.54.47/. A mistake I made was
            forgetting to click the start machine button from Task 1 while solving the
            tasks; but I was able to go back and redo the tasks again when I realized this.

            I found Firefox still loading while the proxy is working and my intercept
            screen on Burp Suite is now populated with the headers corresponding to my
            GET HTTP request to access the address of http://10.10.54.47/. This shows
            that our request has been intercepted by the tool and we can choose to
            forward or drop the request as seen in the below screenshot.

            Furthermore, I was looking into how to intercept and modify the response of
            a request. This took me a while to figure out what this option was and did
            some research. I uncovered the answer and steps in this link and found that
            I could either right click on the body of the request or click the actions
            button; then to hover over Do intercept and to click Response to this request. I
            was able to modify the body of response to whatever I liked and forward the
            request and send it back to the browser.

            </h1>

            Read through the options in the right-click menu.

            There is one particularly useful option that allows you to intercept and
            modify the response to your request.

            What is this option?

            Note: The option is in a dropdown sub-menu.

            <blockquote>
                Response to this request
            </blockquote>

            [Bonus Question — Optional] Try installing FoxyProxy standard and have a
            look at the pattern matching features.
