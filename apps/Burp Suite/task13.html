        Notes

        I started my review of the website by taking a look and visit all the available
        links and pages for http://10.10.54.47/.

        I also noticed that the Submit Support Ticket and Contact pages allowed a
        user to submit their personal information contact emails and phone
        numbers and a message as well. What struck me as odd and concerning was
        that these page endpoints were on a HTTP page instead of the more secure HTTPS, 
        meaning there was no guarantee that connection and information being sent over is secure.

        When I intercepted the request for accessing the /ticket/ endpoint, 
        I noticed a weird request also getting intercepted that was a GET method 
        and had a path of /5yjR2GLcoGoij2ZK, which struck me as very unusual 
        endpoint and something to investigate.

        On my browser, I took the endpoint and added it to the end of the 
        IP address and was able to get the flag text message to answer 
        the 1st following question on this task. I also looked within 
        the Target tab and checked the Site map sub tab for this suspicious request 
        being intercepted and I was also find the THM same flag 
        I got returned to me in the response from the browser.

        To find the typical severity of a Vulnerable JavaScript Dependency issue, 
        I clicked the globe icon in the Issue definitions sub tab of the Target main 
        tab to view a web page list of the list of issues for easy searching and used Ctrl+F 
        to text search the issue and was able to easily find the severity of the issue and answer the question

        Take a look around the site on http://10.10.54.47/ -- 
        we will be using this a lot throughout the module. Visit every page linked to from the homepage, 
        then check your sitemap -- one endpoint should stand out as being very unusual!

        Visit this in your browser (or use the “Response” section of the site map
        entry for that endpoint)

        What is the flag you receive?

        <blockquote>

        Look through the Issue Definitions list.

        What is the typical severity of a Vulnerable JavaScript dependency?
