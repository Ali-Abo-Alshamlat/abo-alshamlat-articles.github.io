        <p>
            So this is a hint that we have to deal with cookies, 
            I visited the source code and I got this great information
        </p>
        <img src="/public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/The Restricted Sessions/The Restricted Sessions-2.png"/>
        <p>so the source code gave me that</p>
        <p>the cookie name: PHPSESSID</p>
        <p>value: [^;]+)/</p>
        <p>just putting these in the cookie’ browser (web developer extension)</p>
        <img src="/public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/The Restricted Sessions/The Restricted Sessions-3.png"/>
        <p>we got this</p>
        <img src="/public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/The Restricted Sessions/The Restricted Sessions-4.png"/>
        <p>Go to the directory gave me these three session’s values</p>
        <img src="/public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/The Restricted Sessions/The Restricted Sessions-5.png"/>
        <p>I tried to test them as a value and I got this</p>
        <img src="/public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/The Restricted Sessions/The Restricted Sessions-6.png"/>
        <p>
            So I went to the burp suite and try to send the cookie in the body, 
            the result of this gave me the valid user name which is mary
        </p>
        <p>Sending the new cookie’s user & value gave me the flag</p>
