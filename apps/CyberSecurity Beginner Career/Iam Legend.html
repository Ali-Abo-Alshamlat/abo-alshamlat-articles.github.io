        <p>We can clearly see that there is an interesting string, which at first I thought would mean brainfuck encrypted stuff, even though it doesn’t really look like one.</p>
        <p>After some “research” i managed to understand how that string was encoded, something called “java-script-fuck obfuscated text“.
