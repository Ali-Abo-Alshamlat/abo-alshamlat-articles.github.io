        <p>the flag is the parameter of the function in the following format (“FLAG{0_%X_0}” % parameter)</p>
        <p>The simplest way to check the file before using any tool is a simple text editor, here’s the output :</p>

            Honestly It’s been a long time since I studied Assembly, 
            I did some research to understand what every instruction does, and here’s what I found :

            In other words, the function means to take the local variable stored in 
            rbp-4 multiply it by 8 (left shift by 3) and compare the result with 5744.

            Yes ! The parameter that we are looking for is the value stored 
            in rbp-4, but how we are supposed to know it ? Simply suppose 
            that <b>parameter*8=5744</b>, that makes the <b>parameter=718</b>.

            Still have the message wrong submission popping up ? Easy, 
            just have another look in the challenge description, 
            it indicates that the format should be : <b>FLAG{0_%X_0}, %X</b> refers to Hexadecimal; 
            As you can already guess the flag

        FLAG{0_2CE_0}
