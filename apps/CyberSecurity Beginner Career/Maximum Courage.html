        <p>First Let’s open the challenge website link</p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-1.png"/>
        <p>as we can see here he saying that we can’t open flag.php and if i try to open it this is the result</p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-2.png"/>
        <p>We can’t access it so let’s go and use some tools to get more information</p>
        <p>
            First we need a tool to Scan the web server for directories the most common 
            2 tools are <a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project">DirBuster</a> and <a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project">dirb</a> i prefere dirb cause it is easy and fast to use
        </p>
        <p>Let’s open my terminal and use the tool on our target</p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-3.png"/>
        <p>After i run dirb it will brutforce the directories using wordlist and after few seconds</p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-4.png"/>
        <p>Here dirb has found a directory called /.git and a file called HEAD</p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-5.png"/>
        <p>it’s another path and if you try to open it it will download a file called master and it’s useless</p>
        <p>
            Now we know that this website has 
            /.git so that’s mean that this website has Git directories so now we need a tool to dump a git repository from a website
            and the perfect tool for this is <a href="https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools">GitTools</a>
        </p>
        <p>After we clone the tool to our machine let’s run it</p>
        <p>If we go into the tool folder we will find three directories</p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-6.png"/>
        <p>
            Dumper , Extractor and Finder are Tools and we need to dump the 
            repository so we will use the Dumper as you can see Dumper is a directory 
            so use “ cd ” to go into it after we open it we will find
        </p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-7.png"/>
        <p>let’s run gitdumper.sh on our website</p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-8.png"/>
        <p>after run the command</p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-9.png"/>
        <p>
            We can now go to our folder i named it Maximum the folder will be 
            located in the same path i ran the tool so let’s open it
        </p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-10.png"/>
        <p>
            we will notice that the folder is empty but if you type ls -a you will find 
            a hidden folder called .git
        </p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-11.png"/>
        <p>
            There is no useful files here so let go back to Maximum and try another tool 
            called git we will use git status to see the 
            changes that have been made for this repository
        </p>
        <img src="../../public/images/CyberSecurity Beginner Career/Maximum Courage/Maximum Courage-12.png"/>
        <p>
            as we can see here the file flag.php has been deleted to restore it we can use 
            git restore flag.php and press enter
        </p>
        <p>Now if we list directory in Maximum folder you will see the flag</p>
