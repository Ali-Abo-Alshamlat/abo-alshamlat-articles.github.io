        <p>An image was leaked from a babies store. the manager is so annoyed 
           because he needs to identify the image to fire charges against the
           responsible employee. the key is the md5 of the image
        </p>
        <p>
            the flag was sent and captured inside the pcap file, 
            but binwalk and foremost couldn’t find anything !
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                ┌─[root@kali]─[~]
                └──╼ #binwalk find\ the\ image.pcap 

                DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

                Processing: find the image.pcap

            </code>
        </p>
        <p>so i took a look at strings inside the pcap …</p>
        <p>
            <code>
                ┌─[root@kali]─[~]
                └──╼ #strings find\ the\ image.pcap  -n 10 | head -n 8
                Sup supp, are we ready
                yeah, u got the files?
                yes but i think the channel is not secured
                the UTM will block the file transfer as the DLP module is active
                ok we can use cryptcat
                ok what the password then
                let it be P@ssawordaya
                listen on 7070 and ill send you the file , bye
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            So they use cryptcat over the port <code>7070</code> with the secret key <code>P@ssawordaya</code> . 
            With wireshark let's filter <code>tcp.port == 7070</code>, then flow TCP stream and save it 
            as raw file.

        <p>
            Then open a netcat client on localhost: 
            <code>netcat localhost 7070 < crypted.file</code>. 
            And open a cryptcat listener on localhost: 
            <code>cryptcat -l -k P@ssawordaya -p 7070 > decrypted.file</code>.
        </p>
