            lord of the rings addict is the user of this application, 
            can you find the creds?, the key is the md5(userpass)
            <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/talentchallenges/Reverse/app.apk.zip">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/talentchallenges/Reverse/app.apk.zip</a>

            First
            Installing <i>apktool</i> tool on Kali Linux can be achieved with the command :
            
            <code>
                apt install apktool
                <img src="/public/images/mobile security/Mobile App/Mobile App-1.jpg"/>
            </code>
        </pre>
        &nbsp;
        <pre>
            As a result, I have successfully obtained the 
            source code of the provided APK file through the utilization of apktool.

            By utilizing the ‘tree’ command, I gain visibility into the contents of all directories, 
            allowing for a comprehensive view of the file structure and organization 
            within the extracted source code.

            After careful observation and attempts to comprehend the underlying logic, 
            I noticed that the ‘assets’ directory contains intriguing content. Particularly, 
            the configuration for the start page resides in the application assets. 
            Upon inspecting the assets directory within the extracted sub-directory, 
            as illustrated in the screenshot below:
            <img src="/public/images/mobile security/Mobile App/Mobile App-3.jpg"/>

            It becomes evident that the page relies on two pieces of JavaScript, 
            namely ‘cordova.js’ and ‘js/index.js.’ A thorough examination of the ‘cordova.js’ 
            file reveals nothing suspicious. However, 
            the ‘index.js’ file presents a different scenario. 
            Pay close attention to the following snippet from the contents of the ‘index.js’ file:

            <img src="/public/images/mobile security/Mobile App/Mobile App-4.jpg"/>

            Within the ‘index.js’ file, I uncovered the flag.

            In our pursuit, I attempted to decode the flag using CyberChef, 
            employing the Base64 decoding method. The decoded result, however, 
            unveiled that the flag is written in the JsFuck language.

            Further analysis and interpretation in the JsFuck language 
            would be necessary to reveal the concealed information within the flag. 
            Of course I will use an online tool to decode it.
