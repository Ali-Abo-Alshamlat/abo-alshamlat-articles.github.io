            In this challenge we are provided with a .NET application which takes input
            from the user and if the input is correct, we shall pass else we will not!

            On running the executable we can see it’s graphical interface!

            As we do not have the code. We need to decompile this executable in order to
            find the inner working of this program. At first i opened up this executable
            in dotPeek.

            <img src="../../public/images/Malware Reverse Engineering/Eye of Sauron/Eye of Sauron-2.png"/>

            On the left side we can see different base types and at the end “txtPass”. This
            clearly shows that the user input will be checked somewhere in the program.
            So this was the time to look a little closer on the code.

            I found the part of the function which will check for the user input and will
            pass him if provided input with match the defined one.

            Reversing the logic of this function we conclude that!

            1. Label 2 + Label 3 + Label 4 + Label 5.
            2. Reverse the strings after combining all 5.

            The logic seems to be quite simple. At first the portions of the input will be
            taken and a single token will be made. Once done, the order of that token
            will be reversed to get the right token!

            At this moment, we need to find those tokens!

            After looking on the program, i found that values were assigned to the
            variables made and these values were being concatenated and then
            reversed.

            <img src="../../public/images/Malware Reverse Engineering/Eye of Sauron/Eye of Sauron-4.png"/>

            Now, as we have the parts of tokens. Its time to combine them and they will
            look like this.

            <blockquote class="mk">
                <i>
                    d0248b4e + 47886655 + 83f05688 + c154b6ea
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            But, when the form will be loaded the text for the label4 will be changed and
            we can conclude that with this private function.

            <img src="../../public/images/Malware Reverse Engineering/Eye of Sauron/Eye of Sauron-5.png"/>

            The previously value for label4 is 83f05688 and the new one is 83f05689. So,
            we need to change this value.

            Also the value for label3 is being changed as soon as the button is clicked!

            <img src="../../public/images/Malware Reverse Engineering/Eye of Sauron/Eye of Sauron-6.png"/>

            The previously value for label3 is 47886655 and the new one is 47996655. 
            So, we need to change this value as well and the token will be!

            <blockquote class="mk">
                <i>
                    d0248b4e + 47996655 + 83f05689 + c154b6ea

                    d0248b4e4799665583f05689c154b6ea
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            Now, we have this token, in order words the hash as it looks like. 
            All we need now is to get it reversed and that can be done easily 
            via “rev” command on Linux!

            <blockquote class="mk">
                <i>
                    ae6b451c98650f3855669974e4b8420d
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            We are all done. Let’s try this on the form!
