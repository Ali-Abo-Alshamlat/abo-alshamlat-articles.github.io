            XSS, or Cross-site scripting, is like a digital sneak attack, where hackers
            exploit your trust in a website to wreak havoc on your browser. By slipping
            malicious scripts into seemingly safe websites, they can make your browser
            do nasty things like stealing your info or hijacking your session. This clever
            trickery bypasses a built-in security guard called Same-Origin Policy, meant
            to keep your browser safe. So, it’s crucial to stay vigilant and be cautious
            when browsing online to avoid falling victim to these sneaky tactics.

                Types of XSS:
            </h2>

            <h2>Reflected XSS:</h2> Hackers trick a website into showing your browser 
            harmful code sent through a link or form.

            <h2>Stored XSS:</h2> Harmful code is stored on a website’s server and runs 
            whenever someone views it.

            <h2>DOM-based XSS:</h2> Tricky code messes with how a web page works in 
            your browser, letting hackers run their own code.
