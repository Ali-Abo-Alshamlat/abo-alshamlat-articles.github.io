            In this challenge we had trace the most recent online activity of a missing
            person. We were given this <a href="https://bitly.com/3frKIAX">https://bitly.com/3frKIAX</a> link which led us to a
            twitter account with protected tweets.

            <img src="../../public/images/Open Source Cyber Intelligence/Missing Person/Missing Person-1.jpg"/>

            From the new twitter url
            <a href="https://twitter.com/rzsdw2iwug77eda/status/1394223468003176455">https://twitter.com/rzsdw2iwug77eda/status/1394223468003176455</a>

            We can spot the username <a href="https://twitter.com/rzsdw2iwug77eda/status/1394223468003176455">rzsdw2iwug77eda</a>  . 
            So immediately my mind went to <a href="https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock">sherlock</a> .

            We get a pastebin, with a date

            <img src="../../public/images/Open Source Cyber Intelligence/Missing Person/Missing Person-3.png"/>

            So apparently this is a red herring. This date wasn’t the user’s most recent activity.

            After thinking for a while. I decided to try and trace when the bit.ly was
            created. My teammate ended up uncovering the trick. By adding a ‘+’ to the end
            of the bit.ly link you can trace when it was first created. The date here was the
            solution
