                What is a Firewall?
            </h3>
            
            A firewall is hardware, software, or a combination of both that is used to prevent unauthorized programs or 
            Internet users from accessing a private network and/or a single computer

            <img src="/public/images/Network Security-1/Network Security-1.jpg"/>

             A firewall :
            ◦ Acts as a security gatewaybetween two networks
            ◦ Tracks and controls network communicationsDecides whether to pass,reject, encrypt, or log
            communications (Access Control)

            <h3>
                Hardware vs. Software Firewalls
            </h3>

            <b>Hardware Firewalls</b>
            ◦ Protect an entire network
            ◦ Implemented on the router level
            ◦ Usually more expensive, harder to configure
            <b>Software Firewalls</b>
            ◦ Protect a single computer
            ◦ Usually less expensive, easier to configure
            

            <h3>
                Packet Filter
            </h3>

            ◦ Packets examined at the network layer
            ◦ Useful “first line” of defense - commonly deployed onrouters
            ◦ Simple accept or reject decision model
            ◦ No awareness of higher protocol layers

            <img src="/public/images/Network Security-1/Network Security-3.jpg"/>

            ◦ Simplest of components
            ◦ Uses transport-layer information only
                ◦ IP Source Address, Destination Address
                ◦ Protocol/Next Header (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc)
                ◦ TCP or UDP source & destination ports
                ◦ TCP Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, PSH, etc)
                ◦ ICMP message type
            ◦ Examples
            ◦ DNS uses port 53
            No incoming port 53 packets except known trusted servers


            <h3>
                How to Configure a Packet Filter
            </h3>

            ◦ Start with a security policy
            ◦ Specify allowable packets in terms of logical expressions on packet fields
            ◦ Rewrite expressions in syntax supported by your vendor
            ◦ General rules - least privilege
                ◦ All that is not expressly permitted is prohibited
                ◦ If you do not need it, eliminate it

            <h3>
                Packet Filter Configuration - 1
            </h3>

            Every ruleset is followed by an implicit rule reading like this.

            action src port dest port flags comment
            block   *   *     *    *   *    default

            Suppose we want to allow inbound mail (SMTP, port 25)
            but only to our gateway machine. Also suppose that
            mail from some particular site SPIGOT is to be blocked.

            <h3>
                Packet Filter Configuration - 2
            </h3>

            action src    port dest   port flags comment
            block SPIGOT    *   *      *     *   We don’t trust 
                                                 these site

            allow  *        *  OUR-GW  25    *   Connection to our
                                                 SMTP port

            Example 2:
            Now suppose that we want to implement the policy “any
            inside host can send mail to the outside”.

            <h3>
                Application Gateway or Proxy
            </h3>

            ◦ Packets examined at the application layer
            ◦ Application/Content filtering possible - prevent FTP “put” commands, for example
            ◦ Modest performance
            ◦ Scalability limited

            <h3>
                Stateful Inspection
            </h3>

            ◦ Packets Inspected between data link layer and network layer in the OS kernel
            ◦ State tables are created to maintain connection context
            ◦ Invented by Check Point

            <h3>
                Network Address Translation (NAT)
            </h3>

            <img src="/public/images/Network Security-1/Network Security-6.jpg"/>

            ◦ Converts a network’s illegal IP addresses to legal or public IP addresses
            ◦ Hides the true addresses of individual hosts, protecting them from attack
            ◦ Allows more devices to be connected to the network

                Overview of IDS/IPS
            </h3>

            ◦ Intrusion
                ◦ A set of actions aimed at compromising the security goals
                (confidentiality, integrity, availability of a computing/networking resource)
            ◦ Intrusion detection
                ◦ The process of identifying and responding to intrusion activities
            ◦ Intrusion prevention
                ◦ The process of both detecting intrusion activities and managing
                  responsive actions throughout the network.
            
            <b>
                ◦ Intrusion detection system (IDS)
            </b>
                ◦ A system that performs automatically the process of intrusion detection.
            
            <b>
                ◦ Intrusion prevention system (IPS)
            </b>
                ◦ A system that has an ambition to both detect intrusions and
                manage responsive actions.
                ◦ Technically, an IPS contains an IDS and combines it with
                preventive measures (firewall, antivirus, vulnerability assessment)
                that are often implemented in hardware.

                Intrusion Detection Approaches
            </h3>

            ◦ Modeling
                ◦ Features: evidences extracted from audit data
                ◦ Analysis approach: piecing the evidences together
                    ◦ Misuse detection (a.k.a. signature-based)
                    ◦ Anomaly detection (a.k.a. statistical-based)

            ◦ Deployment: Network-based or Host-based
                ◦ Network based: monitor network traffic
                ◦ Host based: monitor computer processes

                Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
            </h3>

            <b>
                ◦ LMS - “Log Management System” –
            </b>

            a system that collects and store Log Files (from
            Operating Systems, Applications, etc) from multiple hosts and systems into a single
            location, allowing centralized access to logs instead of accessing them from each system
            individually.

            <b>
                ◦ SLM /SEM – “Security Log/Event Management” –
            </b>

            an LMS, but marketed towards
            security analysts instead of system administrators. SEM is about highlighting log entries as
            more significant to security than others.

            <b>
                SIM – “Security Information Management” -
            </b>

            an Asset Management system, but with
            features to incorporate security information too. Hosts may have vulnerability reports
            listed in their summaries, Intrusion Detection and AntiVirus alerts may be shown mapped
            to the systems involved.

            <b>
                SEC - “Security Event Correlation” –
            </b>

            To a particular piece of software, three failed
            login attempts to the same user account from three different clients, are just three lines in
            their logfile. To an analyst, that is a peculiar sequence of events worthy of investigation, and
            Log Correlation (looking for patterns in log files) is a way to raise alerts when these
            things happen.

            <b>
                SIEM – “Security Information and Event Management” –
            </b>

            SIEM is the “All of the
            Above” option, and as the above technologies become merged into single products,
            became the generalized term for managing information generated from security controls
            and infrastructure. We’ll use the term SIEM for the rest of this presentation

                (also known as audit records, audit trails, event-logs, etc.).
            
            ◦ LM covers log collection, centralized aggregation, long-term
                retention, log analysis (in real-time and in bulk after storage)
                as well as log search and reporting.
