            <h1>
            Vulnerable and Outdated Components — Lab
            </h1>

            This task is about exploiting outdated components. 
            Open Firefox then head to the given site. 
            Looking at the site we learn that this is a bookstore app.
            Go to the Exploit database site and search for the keywords “bookstore”.

            <img src="../../public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task15-2.png"/>

            Download the exploit [47887.py] and use the command:

            python3 47887.py [insert URL] and type “y” to launch the shell. Use the
            command [cat /opt/flag.txt] to reveal the flag. The key to this is you already
            know what file you are looking for /opt/flag.txt and we know that to open it
            we have to use the command [cat].

            What is the content of the /opt/flag.txt file?
            Hint: You know it’s a bookstore application. You should check for recent
            unauthenticated bookstore apps RCEs.
