            <h1>
            Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
            </h1>

            This is a fairly simple task. Download the log file and look at the data.

            Notice the IP address that reoccurs in the span of 15 seconds? That is the
            attack and the IP address is the answer to the first question. The next thing
            to notice is the different attempts. Same IP address, different login names, in
            15 seconds. This is the key to question two. It is a “Brute Force” attack.

            What IP address is the attacker using? Answer Format: **.**.**.**

            What kind of attack is being carried out? Answer Format: ***** *****

            Hint: What do you call trying combinations of usernames and passwords to
            gain access to users’ accounts?
