            <h1>
            Command Injection  
            </h1>

            In this module, we are going to infiltrate the cowsay using Linux commands.
            TryHackMe was kind enough to give us a few basic commands:

            <ul>
            <li>whoami</li>
            <li>id</li>
            <li>ifconfig/ip addr</li>
            <li>uname -a</li>
            <li>ps -ef</li>
            </ul>

            But we will also be using a few others such as:

            <ul>
                <li>$(ls)</li>
                <li>$(ls -la)</li>
                <li>$(cat /etc/passwd)</li>
                <li>$(cat /etc/os-release)</li>
            </ul>

            Now, let's get started. Head to the link given http://machine-ip:82/

            <img src="/public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task10-1"/>

            This was my approach, you can do things you can do things your way. I
            started with the command: $(whoami)

            <img src="/public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task10-2"/>

            This is actually the answer to the third question: apache
            Next, I used the command $(ls) to find any files in the root directory

            <img src="/public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task10-3"/>

            The results are [css drpepper.txt index.php js]. This leads us to the answer to
            the first question.

            After that, it is time to find out the answer to the next question:

            How many non-root/non-service/non-daemon users are there?

            How do we determine that? We use the command $(cat /etc/passwd) to list
            the users. Command broken down is [cat] or concatenate the file called
            [/etc/passwd]

            <img src="/public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task10-4"/>

            <img src="/public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task10-5"/>

            There are no non-root/non-service/non-daemon users (standard users).

            You can also use the command [awk] with a few parameters:

            $(awk -F: ‘$3 >= 1000’ /etc/passwd)

            <img src="/public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task10-5"/>

            Without going in-depth into the command, there are no standard users
            listed; making the answer “0”. The hint here is sbin, which is short for
            system binary. sbin is meant for system admins and should not be accessible
            by standard users. So, seeing /sbin/nologin is an indicator.

            Going back to the question about the user name [apache] we can scroll to the
            bottom and find the user’s [apache] shell [/sbin/nologin].

            <img src="/public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task10-6"/>

            It is time to finish this task, by using a command to find the operating
            system version. The command I used was [$(cat /etc/os-release)] the result
            was straightforward: 3.16.0. You can also use [$(cat /etc/os-release)]

            <img src="/public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task10-7"/>
