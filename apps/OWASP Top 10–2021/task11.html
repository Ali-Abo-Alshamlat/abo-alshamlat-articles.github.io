            Insecure Design  
            </h1>

            Navigate to http://MACHINE_IP:85 and get into joseph’s account. This
            application also has a design flaw in its password reset mechanism. Can you
            figure out the weakness in the proposed design and how to abuse it?

            Time to once again boot up the VM, open Firefox, and make your way to
            http://MACHINE_IP:85. Once you get to the page you should notice that it is a
            login page. 
            We want to use the information that we have so far. THM
            provided that the person’s name is ‘joseph”, but we don’t have a password
            and we are not sure if that is his username. But there is a button that says “I
            forgot my password…” Click it and continue on.

            It will first ask the user name, “joseph” was supplied, so we are using that.
            Now, the question’s hint asks which is the easiest to guess from the three
            options. The first is an impossible task within the scope of this task and so is
            the last question. So we are going to be guessing colors. ROYGBIV (Red,
            Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet) is a safe place to start. I tried
            starting at the spelling variation of Red and finally Bingo! at “green” (it is
            case-sensitive). The system automatically generates a new temp password.
            You should write it down and/or copy and paste it. Use the information to log in.

            <img src="../../public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task11-2.png"/>

            Explore the options and make your way to private.

            <img src="../../public/images/OWASP Top 10–2021/task11-3.png"/>

            Open Flag.txt to get the flag and to finish the task.

            Try to reset joseph’s password. Keep in mind the method used by the site to
            validate if you are indeed joseph.

            No Answer Needed

            What is the value of the flag in joseph’s account?

            Hint: Is there any security question that can be easily guessed?
