                Cryptographic Failures (Challenge)
            </h1>

            Firstly, start up the machine once it is booted up open Firefox and head to
            http://machine-ip:81/. Once there go to the log-in page and view the source
            code. You can view the source code by using the hotkey combo CTRL + U.
            This will open a separate page.

            Have a look around the web app. The developer has left themselves a note
            indicating that there is sensitive data in a specific directory.

            What is the name of the mentioned directory?
            Hint: Have a look at the source code on the /login page.

                Answer: /assets
            </h2>

            Navigate to the directory you found in question one. What file stands out as
            being likely to contain sensitive data?

            <h2>
                Answer: webapp.db
            </h2>
            Use the supporting material to access the sensitive data. What is the
            password hash of the admin user?

            Download the database (.db) and pull up your command line. Now list
            everything in the folder using the ls -l.
            Next, we need to access the database with SQLite3 using sqlite3 webapp.db
            followed by .tables which brings up “users” and finally PRAGMA table_info
            (users)

            Crack the hash.

            What is the admin’s plaintext password?
            Hint: Read the supporting material.

            The supporting material suggests we go to CrackStation. Once at the
            CrackStation site copy and paste the password hash, confirm that you are not
            a robot, and select the “Crack Hashes” button.
