            Connect to OpenVPN first and then deploy the attached VM.

            Now, open the given URL (http://10.10.171.250:3923)

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task5-1.png"/>

            This will be shown up on the screen. Now, navigate to the control-panel
            section and you will see another window opening up.

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task5-2.png"/>

            Now, open burpsuite and turn on the intercept and then try to type
            something into the login search bar. Upon intercepting the traffic, you will
            see that whatever you are writing into the login bar is being reflected in the
            burpsuite window:

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task5-3.png"/>

            I had typed in appleS into the login bar. XD So random!
            This proves that our website has reflected XSS

            Ques 1: What type of vulnerability is it?

            <h2>
                Answer: reflected xss
            </h2>

            Coming back to our control-panel page, we can see that there’s another
            option ‘enable k304’.

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task5-4.png"/>

            Now, open burpsuite and turn on the intercept again. Now, navigate back to
            that page and click on the ‘enable k304’ button to intercept the traffic and
            further modify it.

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task5-5.png"/>

            Now insert the following encoding in front of ?k304=y:

            ?k304=y%0D%0A%0D%0A%3Cimg+src%3Dcopyparty+onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task5-6.png"/>

            Send it to repeater

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task5-7.png"/>

            And here is our answer!

            Ques 2: Use the above exploit against the attached VM. What do you see on
            the second line after go to?

            <h2>
                Answer: /?h#cc
            </h2>
