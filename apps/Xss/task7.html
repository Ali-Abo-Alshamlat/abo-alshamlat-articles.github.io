            </h1>
    
            For this task, navigate to the machine IP and then to the contact page. Now,
            fill out your info and put the message as<script>alert("Simple XSS")
            </script> :

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task7-1.png"/>

            Now, click on ‘Send Message’. Now, go to the login page and log in as
            receptionist. The credentials are given in the description itself.

            Username: admin

            Password: admin123

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task7-2.png"/>

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task7-3.png"/>

            This alert will be prompted on your screen. This proves that this is an
            example of Stored XSS.

            Ques 1: What type of vulnerability is it?

            <h2>
                Answer: Stored XSS
            </h2>

            Now, repeat the same steps again but with a different message this time
            (<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>). You will see a different alert
            popping up.

            <img src="/public/images/Xss/task7-4.png"/>

            This is our key.
            Ques 2: Go to the contact page and submit the following message
            <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>. Next, log in as the Receptionist.
            What is the name of the key from the third displayed key-value pair?

            <h2>
                Answer: PHPSESSID
            </h2>
