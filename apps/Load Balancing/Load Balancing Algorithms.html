            <h3>
                Round Robin
            </h3>

            A very famous algorithm that is classified as static and deterministic. 
            Its working principle is: Requests are distributed sequentially to the servers, 
            as the load balancer has a list of existing servers, and upon each request, 
            it directs the request to the servers in order, starting from the first of this list to the last, 
            and then distributes the requests again from Beginning of the list.

            The figure shows the Round Robin load balancing algorithm, 
            where four requests are received from the load balancer 4, 
            which will be distributed in order, starting from the first in the list of available servers. 
            The first request goes to the first server, the second request goes to the second server, 
            and so on. At the end of the list, it is served from the beginning, so this algorithm is considered circular.

            <h3>
                Weighted Round Robin 
            </h3>

            The same algorithm as the previous one, but each link requires a weight that represents the maximum number
            Of the requests that you can receive and serve based on the health of the server and monitoring
            The dynamics of his condition.

            <h3>
                Least connections
            </h3>

            This algorithm depends on the number of active connections on the server, 
            so that requests are distributed to the server with the least number of active connections 
            until it is equal to the second-lowest server in terms of number.
            Active communications.

            The previous figure shows the service method in the Least Connection algorithm, 
            where service starts from the server that has the least number of active connections, 
            and requests continue to be directed to this server until the number of connections it has becomes 
            equal to the second least number of active connections in the load balancerâ€™s list.
