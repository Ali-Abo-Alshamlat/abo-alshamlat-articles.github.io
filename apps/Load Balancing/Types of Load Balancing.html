        <pre>
            Now that you have an understanding of the basic components that are used in load
            balancing, you can move into the basic types of load balancing.

            <h3>
                No Load Balancing
            </h3>

            A simple web application environment with no load balancing might look like the following:

            <img src="../../public/images/Load Balancing/Load Balancing-1.png"/>

            In this example, the user connects directly to your web server, at yourdomain.com and
            there is no load balancing. If your single web server goes down, the user will no longer
            be able to access your web server. Additionally, if many users are trying to access your 
            server simultaneously and it is unable to handle the load, they may have a slow
            experience or they may not be able to connect at all.

            <h3>
                Layer 4 Load Balancing
            </h3>

            The simplest way to load balance network traffic to multiple servers is to use layer 4
            (transport layer) load balancing. Load balancing this way will forward user traffic based
            on IP range and port (i.e. if a request comes in for http://yourdomain.com/anything, the
            traffic will be forwarded to the backend that handles all the requests for yourdomain.com
            on port 80). For more details on layer 4, check out the TCP subsection of our Introduction to Networking.

            Here is a diagram of a simple example of layer 4 load balancing:

            <img src="../../public/images/Load Balancing/Load Balancing-2.png"/>

            The user accesses the load balancer, which forwards the user’s request to the web-
            backend group of backend servers. Whichever backend server is selected will respond
            directly to the user’s request. Generally, all of the servers in the web-backend should be
            serving identical content–otherwise the user might receive inconsistent content. Note
            that both web servers connect to the same database server.

            <h3>
                Layer 7 Load Balancing
            </h3>

            Another, more complex way to load balance network traffic is to use layer 7 (application
            layer) load balancing. Using layer 7 allows the load balancer to forward requests to
            different backend servers based on the content of the user’s request. This mode of load
            balancing allows you to run multiple web application servers under the same domain and
            port. For more details on layer 7, check out the HTTP subsection of our Introduction to Networking.

            <img src="../../public/images/Load Balancing/Load Balancing-3.png"/>

            In this example, if a user requests yourdomain.com/blog, they are forwarded to the blog
            backend, which is a set of servers that run a blog application. Other requests are
            forwarded to web-backend, which might be running another application. Both backends
            use the same database server, in this example.

            A snippet of the example frontend configuration would look like this:

            <div class="container">
                <deckgo-highlight-code id="codeToCopy">
                    <code slot="code">
                        frontend http
                        bind *:80
                        mode http

                        acl url_blog path_beg /blog
                        use_backend blog-backend if url_blog
                        
                        default_backend web-backend
                    </code></deckgo-highlight-code>
                <button id="copyButton">Copy</button>
            </div>

            This configures a frontend named http, which handles all incoming traffic on port 80.
            acl url_blog path_beg /blog matches a request if the path of the user’s request begins with /blog.
            use_backend blog-backend if url_blog uses the ACL to proxy the traffic to blog-backend.
            default_backend web-backend specifies that all other traffic will be forwarded to web-backend.
