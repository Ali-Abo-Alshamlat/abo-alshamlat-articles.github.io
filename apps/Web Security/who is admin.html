            Your mission is to know who's the admin running this website by knowing his email.

            <img src="/public/images/Web Security/Who is admin/who is admin-1.png"/>

            After open the challenge link we see here a home page and there are images and
            everyone of them has ReadMore link

            <img src="/public/images/Web Security/Who is admin/who is admin-2.png"/>

            So let’s click on that

            <img src="/public/images/Web Security/Who is admin/who is admin-3.png"/>

            We see here there’s a parameter called “id” and it’s equal 2 this is image
            number so its like that:

            <a href="http://18.192.3.151/whoisadmin/shownews.php?id=2">http://18.192.3.151/whoisadmin/shownews.php?id=2</a>

            let’s try to check if it’s vulnerable to SQL injection

            <a href="http://18.192.3.151/whoisadmin/shownews.php?id='">http://18.192.3.151/whoisadmin/shownews.php?id='</a>

            I put a quote and its gave me on burp suite error as we can see in the last image

            <i>Error : HY000 1 unrecognized token: "'"</i>

            <b>So it’s SQL injection</b>

            Get the information from database by Sqlmap

            We will type this command

            <code>
                root@ali:~# sqlmap -u http://18.192.3.151/whoisadmin/shownews.php?id=2 --dump-all

            </code>

            So as we can see we got information and the admin name is Ryan so we need the admin email…
