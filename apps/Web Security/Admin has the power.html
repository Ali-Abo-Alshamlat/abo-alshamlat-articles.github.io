            The CTF page looks like this when you visit the link:-

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Admin has the power/Admin has the power-1.png"/>

            So now inspect the source code of the page:

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Admin has the power/Admin has the power-2.png"/>

            As you can see we have a lead now. Hurray, we have the login credentials of support which are left mistakenly for the repair of the web page.

            Now use these credentials to log in and get access to the support account.

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Admin has the power/Admin has the power-3.png"/>

            Yeah. We are in. We have support privilege. But in order to get the flag we want admin privilege.

            Let’s move on and inspect page. On inspecting the code again nothing suspicious found.

            Let’s inspect the session storage or cookies, that might give us some hint.

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Admin has the power/Admin has the power-4.png"/>

            Here you can see that we have a cookie and a role set to support. Let’s mess with the role, as our aim is to get admin privilege.

            Change this role to : admin

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Admin has the power/Admin has the power-5.png"/>

            As you can see in the image We got the FLAG.
