            Description
            ~simple search website we need to know which cookie to eat ;)

            URL: <a href="http://wlemxj6zq18u6v9yeg23gr7h8v4k1xvky2j9blz0-web.cybertalentslabs.com/">http://wlemxj6zq18u6v9yeg23gr7h8v4k1xvky2j9blz0-web.cybertalentslabs.com/</a>

            Step 1:By visiting challenge link , you will find it has a search box to search
            about images. From challenge name you will know that this site is
            vulnerable for xss

            Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious
            scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites.

            Just make your first step after knowing which bug you are dealing with , is
            testing the vulnerable element

            Step 2:enter any text and check what would change or what is the result for that.

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Searching for the cookie/Searching for the cookie-1.png"/>

            So our search value resulted in the page , your good move is to inspect page
            after getting the result , you can do that by <b>Right click</b> on the page and
            choose <b>inspect</b>

            Or you can just view page source by choosing view page source ,

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Searching for the cookie/Searching for the cookie-2.png"/>

            You will find that search function is implemented using JavaScript and our
            text is placed inside that script & it’s a DOM Based , now you just need to
            know how to inject your script so you can exploit this bug.

            NB//:DOM Based XSS is an XSS attack wherein the attack payload is executed
            as a result of modifying the DOM “environment” in the victim’s browser used
            by the original client side script.

            Now we need to skip page script , if you tried to send ‘};alert(“test”) and
            checked page source again

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Searching for the cookie/Searching for the cookie-3.png"/>

            It won’t work our text added again to page script

            Another try is to close the page script tag and start our own script like

            Your result will pop up meaning that our payload (modified search value) is working

            Last step is to exploit it and make use of our success .

            Step 3:According to challenge description we just need to get cookies from
            this site ,So your payload would be like

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Searching for the cookie/Searching for the cookie-4.png"/>

            Your flag appeared finally.

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Searching for the cookie/Searching for the cookie-5.png"/>
