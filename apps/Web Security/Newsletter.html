            the administrator put the backup file in the same root folder 
            as the application, help us download this backup by retrieving the backup file name

            let’s open the website

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Newsletter/Newsletter-1.png"/>

            As you can see there is a input box and we can use it to make Command
            Injection Attack so first let’s test and try to put some inputs

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Newsletter/Newsletter-2.png"/>

            This input box just take emails so let’s insert a dummy mail like
            test@mail.com

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Newsletter/Newsletter-3.png"/>

            Now we need to know what is the variable name or we can say the name of
            the input and to know the name we need to use a tool to intercept the
            requests and the best tool for that is <i>BurpSuit</i>

            After running burpsuit and intercept the connection while we sending the
            dummy mail we can see the request

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Newsletter/Newsletter-4.png"/>

            Now we have the input name and now we can send this request to the
            repeater to edit the value and put our commands to send to the repeater you
            can use CTRL + R or Right-Click and choose Send to Repeater

            After we sent it to the repeater now we can edit the value and put our
            commands for us we need to us “ls” to list directory

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Newsletter/Newsletter-5.png"/>

            The semicolon (;) will end the code block to start our commands and the (||)
            to let the code know the start from (ls) and ignore the dummy mail in the
            first after typing the command let’s send the request

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Newsletter/Newsletter-6.png"/>

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Newsletter/Newsletter-7.png"/>

            Did you notice the difference ? the command has been executed and the
            output from line 9 to 11…..in the challenge he was asking for the backup file
            name as you can see in line 10 we have the backup file so now you can copy
            the full name of the file and submit it.
