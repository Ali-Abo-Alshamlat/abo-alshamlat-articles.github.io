            Das Kinda weird Just Do it

            So this was some weird bloq as stated. 
            I went to the search bar and tried searching for a raandom word but 
            it didn't show any results. I thought for a while and decide to put search for the following;

            <code>
                a || b
            </code>

            After seaching for it, the following was displayed.

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/WEIRD BLOQ/WEIRD BLOQ-1.png"/>

            I fuzzed the url and I got a robots.txt file. 
            I opened the <i>robots.txt</i> file and got a <i>git.phps</i>
            which was downloadable file which contained the source code;

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/WEIRD BLOQ/WEIRD BLOQ-2.png"/>

            After minutes of research the i finally found the payload that could get the flag

            <code>
                h%a' uNion(sElect(t.cOlumn_name)from(sElect(cOlumn_name),(table_namE)from(infOrmation_schema.COLUMNS)having(table_namE)=('FL@g'))t)#
            </code>
        </pre>
