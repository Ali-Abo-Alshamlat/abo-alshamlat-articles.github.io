            The company hired an inexperienced developer, but he told them he hided
            the database and have it encrypted so the website is totally secure, can you
            prove that he is wrong ??

            started by visiting the website, and found this interesting thing in the source code

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Encrypted Database/Encrypted Database-1.png"/>

            so visiting this directory did not give us anything. I tried to go to secret-
            admin and it gave me a login page

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Encrypted Database/Encrypted Database-2.png"/>

            Found a hidden directory in the loginâ€™ source code

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Encrypted Database/Encrypted Database-3.png"/>
            
            look to the great directory that is written!

            visiting it fave me this string

            <img src="../../public/images/Web Security/Encrypted Database/Encrypted Database-4.png"/>

            This is a MD5 string, decrypt it and you will get the flag
